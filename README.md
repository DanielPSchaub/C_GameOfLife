# C_GameOfLife
Conwayâ€™s Game of Life, written in C, using binary file inputs for starting map. 

Takes two arguments: 
1) the binary file (you'll find them easily by their lack of ".XXX" filename
2) number of generations to run

The code is kept in "main.c"

The currently compilied program is "Conway"

The four binary files are: "blinkers", "glider", "random", and "still" 

Your results will be output into the terminal, else you can pipe it into a file as such: "./Conway random 100 > out.txt"

Largely ignore "testInts.txt", that's really only for extensive debugging

Thank you for looking!
